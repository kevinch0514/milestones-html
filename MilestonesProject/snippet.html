      The tags used in the snippet are the paragraph tag and the anchor tag. <br>

      In terms of the relationship between the two tags, the anchor tag is nesting within the paragraph tag.
      In other words, the anchor tag is the child of the paragraph tag, the parent.
      <br>
      In both the paragraph and anchor tags, there's a forward slash.
      The forward slash within the tags indicate that it is the end tag. Without it, it is the start tag.
      <br>
      In the anchor tag, there is an href attribute, an id attribute, a class attribute, and a target attribute.
      <br>
      The value of the href attribute is https://google.com
      The value of the id attribute is the-best-link
      The value of the class attribute is banana
      The value of the target attribute is _blank
      <br>
      The href attribute defines a hyperlink, so it link to google.com
      The id attribute defines an element to be manipulated by CSS, so the font/color/etc. can be modified
      The class attribute names the element, so the name of the image in banana
      The target attribute indicates where to display the response, so it'll open a new tab
